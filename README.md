# Overview ⚽
An App to help people to organize football matches in the area of Trento. This project was thought like an alternative to the classic WhatsApp or Telegram groups or channels giving a vertical purpose
on the football matches organization. This app is not only to organize events but mainly to generate networking between people that live in the same city for different or same purposes like studing or working.
The idea behind was to create events with the possbility to choose between private or public match, if the event is private only gthe people of the same group can join to the event BUT if I didn't reach the minimun number of players I can switch it in public so anyone can
see the event in the public list and join to it. I find it a dinamic way to create football matches giving precedence to your circle of friends but also with the possibility to meet new people doing something that is recreational.

## Why did I make this Application? 
In the first place, I made this Application to learn some stuff about the App Developing and gain familiarity with the Kotlin programming language. In second hand I did this project for an university course about 
the developing of applications with Jetpack Compose which exam was to create an application based on a your idea, well I found it pretty interesting because this type of projects require you some creativity and also help
you to improve your skills.

## What is possible to do with this app?
I developed some interesting features inside this application just to cover a lot of functionalities. Here a short list:

1. Creation of a personal user profile so people can recognize you.
3. Search for other users in the system.
4. Possibility to create a friends' group.
5. Creation of events (public or private).
6. Notifications for event creation or for some updates.

## Tools that I used
For this project I used Android Studio and Jetpack Compose as a framework. For backend services I equipped myself with Supabase, an open source BaaS platform which provides a wide range of tools based on a PostgreSQL database.
For the project I used the services like: 

- Authentication
- Database
- Storage
